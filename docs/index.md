# About Us

We are four Computing students at Imperial College London. Mobilise was born out of our 2nd year WebApps project. The goal of this project is to provide simple and effective volunteer coordination software that reduces the number of understaffed shifts using smart recommendations.

The app is currently deployed at <https://city-harvest.mobilise.xyz/>
